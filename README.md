In our system, the input file (e.g., `audio.data`) is a binary file containing vectors in 32-bit floating-point (`float32`) format. Compared to text-based formats, binary files enable significantly faster read times and lower storage overhead, rendering them particularly effective for scalable and memory-efficient retrieval in high-dimensional vector spaces.

We extended this support to handle multi-vector inputs per document, enabling retrieval over sets of semantic embeddings instead of single vectors. Example input files such as [`audio.data`](https://github.com/RSIA-LIESMARS-WHU/LSHBOX-sample-data) are stored in the [`float32` data type](https://github.com/RSIA-LIESMARS-WHU/LSHBOX?tab=readme-ov-file), commonly used for efficient vector storage.

## Experimental Setup

VectorSearch was tested in both local and cloud environments to validate scalability and performance.

- **Local Environment:**  
  Intel Core i5-11400H CPU @ 2.70GHz  
  16 GB DDR4 RAM  
  NVIDIA RTX 3050 GPU (4 GB VRAM)  
  Ubuntu 22.04.3, Python 3.10

- **Cloud Environment (Azure):**  
  Standard_E64ds_v4 Virtual Machine  
  64 vCPUs, 504 GiB RAM  
  Intel Xeon Platinum 8272CL  
  Ubuntu 22.04, Python 3.10

All embeddings were computed using [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/) (v2.2.2).
VectorSearch introduces a novel hybrid indexing system that coarse retrieval via quantization-based filtering with lightweight graph refinement, enabling scalable, memory-efficient, and dynamic multi-vector retrieval across large embedding spaces.

Retrieval experiments were performed using 10,000 queries, and all reported metrics represent the average of five independent runs.

Scripts for local and cloud deployment are included for reproducibility.
